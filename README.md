# Adventure Game

## Step 1: Planning the Game
Before diving into coding, it's important to plan the game structure and define the objects and interactions. Consider the different elements of the game, such as characters, locations, items, and actions. Determine how they relate to each other and the gameplay flow.

## Step 2: Create the Game Classes
In this text adventure game, we can start by creating the following classes:

1. Player: Represents the player character. It can have attributes like name, health, inventory, and location.
2. Location: Represents a specific place in the game world. It can have attributes like name, description, and connected locations.
3. Item: Represents an item that the player can interact with. It can have attributes like name, description, and actions.

## Step 3: Implement the Classes


## Step 4: Build the Game World
Create instances of `Player`, `Location`, and `Item` classes to build the game world. Connect the locations, assign initial items, and define the starting point for the player.

## Step 5: Implement Game Logic
Now, it's time to write the main game logic that allows the player to interact with the game world. This typically involves taking player input, parsing commands, and updating the game state accordingly.

## Step 6: Test and Expand the Game
Test the game and play and experiment with different commands and interactions. Expand the game by adding new classes, actions, puzzles, or a storyline.# python_adventure_game
